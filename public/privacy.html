    <h1>Privacy Policy for EXIF Viewer</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: May 23, 2025</em></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how EXIF Viewer ("the App") collects, uses, and discloses your personal information when you use our service.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use the EXIF Viewer app, we may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Profile Information:</strong> We use Google Sign-In to authenticate your identity. Through this process, we may access your basic Google profile information, such as your name and email address. This information is used solely to authenticate you and personalize your experience within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Photos Media Metadata:</strong> When you use the Google Photos Picker API through the App, you grant us permission to read metadata (such as filename, dimensions, creation time, camera model, and other EXIF-like data) and temporarily access the content (image/video bytes) of the photos and videos you explicitly select.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> To sign you in to the App and identify you as a user.</li>
        <li><strong>Providing App Functionality:</strong> To display the photos and videos you select from your Google Photos library, along with their metadata, directly within the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p><strong>EXIF Viewer does not store your photos, videos, or any of their content persistently on our servers.</strong> We do not share any of your personal information (including your Google profile information or photo/video metadata) with any third parties.</p>
    <p>Access to your Google Photos content is direct from your browser to Google's servers, proxied only temporarily through our secure serverless functions to enable display within the App, and is always initiated by your explicit selection.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not store your photos, videos, or their content. Your Google Access Token is used temporarily during your session and is not persistently stored by the App. Session data related to your picker selection is also temporary and expires after a short period (e.g., 60 minutes).</p>

    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect the information we handle. Access to your Google Photos is managed through secure Google OAuth 2.0 protocols.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can revoke the App's access to your Google Photos at any time through your Google Account settings (<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/connections" target="_blank">Google Account Security Settings</a>).</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
