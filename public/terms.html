    <p><em>Last updated: May 23, 2025</em></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the EXIF Viewer application ("the App") operated by [Your Name/Company Name, e.g., "A Personal Project"] ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

    <p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
    <p>EXIF Viewer provides a service that allows users to select photos and videos from their Google Photos library via the Google Photos Picker API and display their metadata and content within the App. The App acts as a viewer and does not provide storage services for your media.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for your own use of the App and for the content you choose to display.</li>
        <li>You agree to use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and not for any unlawful or prohibited activities.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that the App relies on access to your Google Photos, and that your use of Google Photos is governed by Google's own terms of service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the operation or availability of the App or the information, content, materials, or products included on the App.</p>
    <p>We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. We are not responsible for any issues arising from your use of Google Photos or the Google Photos Picker API.</p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall EXIF Viewer, nor its owner(s), be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the App; (iii) any content obtained from the App; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your State/Country, e.g., California, USA], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
